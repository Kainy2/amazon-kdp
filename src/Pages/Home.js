        <Text>
          I screamed with a loud voice probably for the third time in the middle of the night...causing disturbance to the neighborhood and as well lovers who were yet to be served BREAKFAST ( i.e heartbreak) having a recommitment to themselves after the heated Valentine's day celebration of 2021..

          Who am I to be caught in the arms of a woman after being severely frustrated from working like an Elephant and eating like an Ant and worst still, bearing the big fat but almost useless title of Chief Content Creator - working for brands who didn't value the mental energy and stress I put into research and creating content.

        </Text>

        <Text>
        This opportunity is called - Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing
        </Text>

        <Text>
        And what's it all about?
        </Text>

        <Text>
        Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing is the publishing section of Amazondotcom where you can publish books either long reads (books with hundreds of pages), short reads (books with lesser pages) or even Low and no content books like notebook, log book, sketch book, colouring books, puzzle books, activity books etc. for FREE and get patronized from all over the world by the over 300-million active customers of Amazonâ€¦
        </Text>

        <Text>
        â€¦and also very sweetly, get paid directly into your bank account.
        </Text>

        <Text>
        So How Can You Earn From This Opportunity Like Others Are Doing And Start Your Journey To Making The Rest Of Your Life The Best Of Your Life?
        </Text>

        <Text>
        It's very simple..
        </Text>

        <Text>
        Letâ€™s say you CREATE (Not Write) and PUBLISH a book and price it at $9.99 and letâ€™s assume 100 people buy that book in a month
        </Text>

        <Text>
        Thatâ€™s $999 for you.
        </Text>

        <Text>
        What if you have more books or what if you even priced your book(s) more than $9.99 (as the example above)
        </Text>

        <Text>
        Then you make more money..
        </Text>

        <Text>
        Do you see that? Easy-peasy..
        </Text>

        <Text>
        Now, the reason I said you mustn't be a writer or close to any of those for you to start publishing your creatives on Amazon kindle is that there's a special BONUS package/formula Mr. Wealth gives all his students called the WRITING WITHOUT WRITING FORMULA.
        </Text>

        <Text>
        With this particular formula, you'll learn how to CREATE and PUBLISH at least one book per day.
        </Text>

        <Text>
        And even if you are very busy or lazy, with this formula, you can be guaranteed of  creating and publishing a minimum of 15 books in 30 days
        </Text>

        <Text>
        Bad as ee badâ€¦
        </Text>

        <Text>
        Now, if each of this 15 books give you just $100 each in 30 days
        </Text>

        <Text>
        That is pure $1,500 in 30 days.
        </Text>

        <Text>
        What if you make $200 from each of the 15 books in 30 days?, IS THAT NOT A MASSIVE $3,000 (15 X $200)
        </Text>

        <Text>
        You can convert it to your local currency.
        </Text>

        <Text>
        In Nigeria, it is over N1,500,000 in just 30 days
        </Text>

        <Text>
        One interesting thing about having your books published on Amazon Kindle is that your book can be just 20 pages, 25 pages, 30 pages or moreâ€¦
        </Text>

        <Text>
        No limitations...
        </Text>

        <Text>
        and it can be selling for life as long as you donâ€™t unpublish it..
        </Text>

        <Text>
        Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing is a simple and easy plug and play method for you to make unbelievable income for yourself monthly without even distorting your normal daily and work plans..
        </Text>

        <Text>
        - Even if you don't have any writing skill or flair for writing.
        </Text>

        <Text>
        - Even if you're a student or work as a 9-5
        </Text>

        <Text>
        And more especially...
        </Text>

        <Text>
        - If you're already an author and you haven't made a dime from your book at least to cover up cost of production but you keep getting accolades and compliments of You're a good writer - keep it up' while your bank account remains constant at zero figures with 'sapa' threatening your life day and night..
        </Text>

        <Text>
        This opportunity will be of a huge impact to you - your writing skill and your financial status just like it is to (Name of two students)

        I wonder how life would have been to many Nigerians whom the labour market had been cruel to if Mr. Wealth decided to hoard his knowledge and expertise about Amazon kindle publishing..
        </Text>

        <Text>
        And no matter what your own life may look like - maybe good enough but you desire to make it better or the best or maybe not so good the way you had planned it in your head...all those doesn't matter now as long as you're READY to take prompt and immediate action...and before you know, sooner than you think, you'll be chilling with the big boysâ€¦ Counting your money in dollars..
