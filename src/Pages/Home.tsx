            <Text>
              Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing is the publishing section of Amazon.com where you can publish books either long reads (books with hundreds of pages), short reads (books with lesser pages) or even Low and no content books like notebook, log book, sketch book, colouring books, puzzle books, activity books etc. for FREE and get patronized from all over the world by the over 300-million active customers of Amazon…

            <Text>
              …and also very sweetly, get paid directly into your bank account.

          Let’s say you CREATE (Not Write) and PUBLISH a book and price it at $9.99 and let’s assume 100 people buy that book in a month
        </Text>

        <Text>
          That’s $999 for you.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          What if you have more books or what if you even priced your book(s) more than $9.99 (as the example above)?
        </Text>

        <Text>
          Then you make more money...

          Do you see that? Easy-peasy..
        </Text>

        <Text>
          Now, the reason I said you mustn't be a writer or close to any of those for you to start publishing your creatives on Amazon kindle is that there's a special formula called the <span className='font-semibold'> WRITING WITHOUT WRITING FORMULA</span>, that makes publishing on Amazon very easy ...
          {/* Mr. Wealth gives all his students  */ }
        </Text>

        <Text>
          With this particular formula, you'll be able to CREATE and PUBLISH at least one book per day.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          And even if you are very busy or lazy with this formula, you can be guaranteed of  creating and publishing a minimum of 15 books in 30 days
        </Text>

        <Text>
          Bad as ee bad…
        </Text>

        <Text>
          Now, if each of these 15 books give you just $100 each in 30 days,
        </Text>

        <Text>
          That is pure $1,500 in 30 days.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          What if you make $200 from each of the 15 books in 30 days? IS THAT NOT A MASSIVE $3,000? (15 X $200)
        </Text>

        <Text>
          You can convert it to your local currency.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          In Nigeria, it is over N1,500,000 in just 30 days
        </Text>

        <Text>
          One interesting thing about having your books published on Amazon Kindle is that your book can be just 20 pages, 25 pages, 30 pages or even more…
        </Text>

        <Text>
          No limitations...
        </Text>

        <Text>
          and it can be selling for life as long as you don’t unpublish it..
