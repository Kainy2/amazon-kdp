          Let’s say you CREATE and PUBLISH a book and price it at $9.99 and let’s assume 100 people buy that book in a month
        </Text>

        <Text>
          That’s $999 for you.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          What if you have more books or what if you even priced your book(s) more than $9.99 (as the example above)
        </Text>

        <Text>
          Then you make more money..

          Do you see that? Easy-peasy..
        </Text>

        <Text>
          Now, the reason I said you mustn't be a writer or close to any of those for you to start publishing your creatives on Amazon kindle is that there's a special BONUS package/formula Mr. Wealth gives all his students called the WRITING WITHOUT WRITING FORMULA.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          With this particular formula, you'll learn how to CREATE and PUBLISH at least one book per day.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          And even if you are very busy or lazy, with this formula, you can be guaranteed of  creating and publishing a minimum of 15 books in 30 days
        </Text>

        <Text>
          Bad as ee bad…
        </Text>

        <Text>
          Now, if each of this 15 books give you just $100 each in 30 days
        </Text>

        <Text>
          That is pure $1,500 in 30 days.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          What if you make $200 from each of the 15 books in 30 days?, IS THAT NOT A MASSIVE $3,000 (15 X $200)
        </Text>

        <Text>
          You can convert it to your local currency.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          In Nigeria, it is over N1,500,000 in just 30 days
        </Text>

        <Text>
          One interesting thing about having your books published on Amazon Kindle is that your book can be just 20 pages, 25 pages, 30 pages or more…
